33 years old, white

work in IT, sitting all day
living in Germany

I was bulking but ended up eating a lot of junk food and got fat. trying to cut down now.
I managed to get lean 2-3 times before, mostly by eating low-carb. I´dont really miss carbs, once I get over the junk food addiction.

goals:
get lean, optimize energy and testosterone
trying to get my wife pregnant (we haven´t really started yet), trying to optimize for healthy and strong offspring

*********
medical conditions:
I have hay fever, allergic against some grasses. but in the recent years symptoms have almost disappeared.
I am lactose intolerant.
I have problems with a tight neck a lot. when very intense it´s to the point where I get slightly dizzy.
Which leads to me stretching and rolling out my back, which leads to improving tightness,
which leads to me not stretching, which leads to a tight neck. :/

recently tore some muscle in my forearm and stopped all exercise for about eight weeks. just got back to the gym last week.
I went to the gym around 4-5 times per week, before the injury and plan on doing so again.
